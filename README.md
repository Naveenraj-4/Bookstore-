Welcome to **Vetri-Nichyam**, my evolving full-stack ecosystem where I experiment, learn, break things, rebuild them, and grow into a stronger developer every day.  
This is not just a project folder…  
It’s my **journey**, **timeline**, and **personal development playground**.

# 🎯 What This Repository Is

**Vetri-Nichyam** is my full-stack learning universe filled with multiple mini-projects such as:

- UI component experiments  
- React mini-apps  
- Express backend setups  
- Login systems  
- MVC practice modules  
- API experiments  
- Code architecture trials  

Everything here is handwritten.  
No auto-gen.  
Pure learning.

👨‍💻 Me (Naveen):  
I don’t want to just follow tutorials… I want to understand the system.

🧠 My Mind:  
Then create. Fail. Improve. Repeat.

💾 Repo:  
I’ll store it all — clean, organized, scalable.

✨ Vetri-Nichyam:  
Start building. Success is certain.
